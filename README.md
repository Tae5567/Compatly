# Compatly

**Design with Confidence, Ship with Certainty.**

Compatly is a design-first CSS compatibility checker that validates web features against Baseline standards before a single line of code is written. Available as both a Figma plugin and web application, Compatly helps designers and developers catch browser compatibility issues early, when they're easiest and cheapest to fix.

## What Problem Does Compatly Solve?

Browser compatibility issues are discovered too late‚Äîoften in production after designs are implemented. This leads to:
- **Costly rework** when incompatible CSS needs alternatives
- **Delayed launches** while debugging cross-browser issues  
- **Poor user experience** on unsupported browsers
- **Developer frustration** fixing avoidable problems

**Compatly shifts compatibility validation left**‚Äîfrom production to design‚Äîcatching issues when changes are easy and inexpensive.

## Understanding Your Results

### Baseline Score

Your **Baseline Compatibility Score** (0-100) indicates how compatible your CSS is with modern browsers:

- **90-100**: Excellent! Highly compatible across all browsers
- **75-89**: Good! Minor compatibility considerations
- **50-74**: Fair. Some features need fallbacks
- **Below 50**: Poor. Significant compatibility issues

### Feature Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning | What to Do |
|--------|---------|------------|
| üü¢ **Widely Available** | Supported in all major browsers | Safe to use! |
| üîµ **Newly Available** | Recently became baseline | Use with recent browser targets |
| üü° **Limited** | Partial or emerging support | Provide fallbacks |
| üî¥ **Not Available** | Not in Baseline | Use alternatives |

### Browser Support Charts

The horizontal bar chart shows **minimum browser versions** that support each detected feature:

- **Chrome**: Google Chrome desktop & Android
- **Firefox**: Mozilla Firefox desktop
- **Safari**: Safari on macOS & iOS  
- **Edge**: Microsoft Edge

### Recommendations

For features with limited support, Compatly provides:
- **Fallback suggestions** - Alternative CSS approaches
- **Polyfill options** - JavaScript libraries for compatibility
- **Progressive enhancement** - How to layer support

### What Features Does Compatly Detect?

#### In Figma Plugin

- **Flexbox** (Auto Layout) - `display: flex`, `flex-direction`
- **CSS Grid** (Layout Grids) - `display: grid`, `grid-template-columns`
- **Gap** (Item Spacing) - `gap` property
- **Backdrop Filter** (Background Blur) - `backdrop-filter: blur()`
- **Aspect Ratio** - `aspect-ratio` property
- **Border Radius** - `border-radius`
- **Transforms** (Rotation) - `transform: rotate()`
